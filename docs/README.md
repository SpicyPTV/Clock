# Clock Web App

# Welcome to the developer branch!

This branch will recieve very frequent updates beign every day or two so you get the most up to date version with all of the features that I am  currently working on but bearing in mind with this constant update schedule bugs and glitches should be expected. This branch is not recommended for general users but for developers who want to implement the app into their OS so they can implement new features on the newest builds. If you ae a general user that wants to see new features before they have released please use the beta channel instead.

## What is Clock Web App?

Clock App is an Open Source web app developed for beign used in Web based OS. It is powerful and feature rich giving consumers and developers a good experience with intuitive UI. Code is formatted clearly and commented to allow developers to make changes and edit the code to fit with their OS.

## Is it Open Source?

100% Yes! Anyone can download and edit the code. If you add a feature that you think the main version should have submit the code in a pull request and it will be added in 1 - 2 updates time if it is good and credit will be given. Check the license for more details.

If you edit the code then implement it into your OS change the build info, where it says '(Official Build)' replace the official with your name / company name

## How do I submit a bug report / feature request?

Go to the GitHub Repositorie (https://github.com/SpicyPTV/ClockWebApp) and click on the issues tab, once there create a new issue. Then you must select between three options available.

Once you have chosen fill out *ALL of the information and I will fix the issue within 1 - 2 updates. Feature requests will only be implemented if I think it is good enough and credit will be given to the requestor but if you are a programmer and have added the feature in yourself to a version you have dowloaded please submit in a pull request instead as it will be easier to implement.

*You must fill out all the information or the report will be ignored

## How often are updates released?

Updates will come out regularly but major updates will come out every 3 months or so but many patches with small features and improvements will come out in between. Beta versions may also be released but these are unstable and we recommend you do not add them to your OS or Website but just use them to get an idea as to what is coming next. Next release will be v1.1.2

Next Update: TBA (To Be Announced)

## How can I use Clock Web App in my OS / website?

Download the most recent release from the GitHub page and copy the 'index.html', 'style.css' and 'main.js' files and paste them in your apps folder in the OS. Then you can edit the code to how you like it or just leave it but make sure to check for updates on the GitHub page
